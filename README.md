# Traffic Light Simulation

This project simulates a traffic light system using TypeScript. The traffic light changes colors every 10 seconds, cycling through Red, Green, and Yellow states.

## Features

- Enum definition for traffic light states
- Function to change traffic light state every 10 seconds
- Console logging of the current traffic light state

# Calculator Interface Implementation

This project provides a TypeScript implementation of a calculator interface. The interface defines methods for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The implementation includes input validation to ensure that provided values are numbers and handles division by zero appropriately.

## Features

- Interface definition for calculator operations
- Implementation of arithmetic operations
- Input validation for numeric values
- Division by zero handling

## Interface Definition

The `ICalculator` interface defines the following methods:

- `add(a: nany, b: any): number | string`
- `subtract(a: any, b: any): number | string`
- `multiply(a: any, b: any): number | string`
- `divide(a: any, b: any): number | string`
